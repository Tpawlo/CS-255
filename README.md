Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The main client of the DriverPass system was Liam. Liam is the owner of DriverPass. Liam wanted us to design a system that would
allow users to practice for their driving exam. They would be able to use this system to schedule on the road practice lessons,
as well as take online tests. Within the interface, they would be able to review past test questions and view instructor feedback
about their lessons to help them learn and prepare for their driver's tests.


What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well on the Business Requirements Document. I think I did a very thorough job going through the interview transcript
and picking out all the relevant pieces that were needed in order to design and prepare for this system. I was able to answer all
parts of the document with specific and sufficient details. I also did not run into much trouble when completing this assignment.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to choose one part of my work to revise, I would most likely choose the UML Diagrams. While I think overall I did a good
job completing the UML Diagrams with all the relevant and correct information, I think with a little more research I could have
done a better job creating them. UML Diagrams help programmers see what the design for the program should be, and lets them all
be on the same page. If I could, I would go back and add more details into some of my UML Diagrams.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When designing a program or system, it is important to interpret the user needs and implement them into the system design. One way to do this is by checking the project requirements document. Here, a programmer can look at all the general ideas and requests of the user and begin thinking about the ways they can be incorporated into the project. If there is any confusion, it is always a good idea to get clarification from the user before continuining on with your work. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing
software because the majority of the time, the software is being built at the user's request. If a user is requesting that their program
be done in a certain way, it is the programmers responsbility to meet their expectations and build the system in a way that satisfies
their needs.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I am still learning what approach works best for me when designing software. In the early stages, I like to take it slow so that I know I am prepared to start working on the project. I usually start by reading the project requirements a few times and taking notes on what I will need to accomplish. I can then start thinking about the ways I plan on completing these tasks. Once I have a plan in place, I can begin working on the actual code. I like the idea of creating and using a business requirements document to help gather the functionalities and capabilities that the program must contain and using this to check that my design does actually contain them.
